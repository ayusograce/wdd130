            <p>Hello, my name is Grace! I am from Manabí, Ecuador. I am a BYU-Idaho student working on a Web and Computer Programming certificate, on my path to the title of Web Programmer. </p>
            <p>I enjoy solving puzzles, reading books (specially fantasy books, although I can enjoy almost any kind of novel) and listening to stories, specially the ones that other people tell me about their lifes and experiences.  </p>
            <p>I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I had the opportunity to serve as a missionary for the church in the Quito, Ecuador Mission from 2022 to 2023. That experience had marked my life and now I want to help and serve more people. It is one of my goals be able to help people with my abilities, so I am on my way to keep learning and growing to help others.</p>
